This section serves as a guide for stakeholders to understand the technical and architectural aspects of the proposed E-commerce system. It sets the stage for more detailed discussions and further elaboration in subsequent sections of the BRD.\par
\par
In an E-commerce website with a microservices architecture, you can break down the system into several independent modules or microservices, each handling a specific business capability. Here's a suggestion for potential modules in your project:\par
\par
1. **User Management Microservice:**\par
   - Manages user registration, authentication, and authorization.\par
   - Handles user profiles, preferences, and account settings.\par
\par
2. **Product Management Microservice:**\par
   - Manages the product catalog.\par
   - Includes operations for adding, updating, and deleting products.\par
   - Handles product details, categories, and inventory.\par
\par
3. **Order Management Microservice:**\par
   - Manages the processing of customer orders.\par
   - Handles order creation, modification, and cancellation.\par
   - Integrates with payment services for order transactions.\par
\par
4. **Shopping Cart Microservice:**\par
   - Manages the shopping cart functionality for users.\par
   - Handles adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.\par
   - Calculates the total price and manages cart persistence.\par
\par
5. **Payment Microservice:**\par
   - Integrates with external payment gateways.\par
   - Handles payment processing for customer orders.\par
   - Ensures secure and reliable financial transactions.\par
\par
6. **Recommendation Microservice:**\par
   - Provides personalized product recommendations to users.\par
   - Analyzes user behavior and purchase history to suggest relevant products.\par
\par
7. **Review and Rating Microservice:**\par
   - Manages product reviews and ratings submitted by users.\par
   - Allows users to view and submit reviews for products.\par
\par
8. **Notification Microservice:**\par
   - Handles communication with users through notifications.\par
   - Sends order confirmation, shipping updates, and promotional messages.\par
\par
9. **Authentication and Authorization Microservice:**\par
   - Provides centralized authentication and authorization services for all microservices.\par
   - Ensures secure and consistent access control across the system.\par
\par
10. **Frontend Microservice (React):**\par
    - Represents the user interface of the E-commerce application.\par
    - Communicates with backend microservices through APIs.\par
    - Manages user interactions, views, and overall user experience.\par
\par
Each microservice is designed to be independent, with its own database and APIs for communication with other microservices. This modular approach allows for easier scalability, maintainability, and flexibility in the development and deployment of your E-commerce system. Additionally, it enables teams to work on different microservices concurrently, promoting a more agile and efficient development process. Keep in mind that this is a high-level suggestion, and the specific modules may be adjusted based on your project's unique requirements and considerations.\par
